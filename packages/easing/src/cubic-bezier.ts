/**
 *  A Bézier curve (/ˈbɛz.i.eɪ/ BEH-zee-ay)[1] is a parametric curve used in computer graphics and related
 *  fields.[2] A set of discrete "control points" defines a smooth, continuous curve by means of a formula.
 *  Usually the curve is intended to approximate a real-world shape that otherwise has no mathematical representation or
 *  whose representation is unknown or too complicated. The Bézier curve is named after French engineer Pierre Bézier (1910–1999),
 *  who used it in the 1960s for designing curves for the bodywork of Renault cars.[3] Other uses include the design of computer fonts and animation.[3]
 *  Bézier curves can be combined to form a Bézier spline,
 *  or generalized to higher dimensions to form Bézier surfaces.[3]
 *  The Bézier triangle is a special case of the latter.
